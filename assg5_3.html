                Piedmont, or mountain, glaciers are found in many parts of the world.
                In North America they are distributed along the mountain ranges of the Pacific Coast 
                from central California northward.
                They abound in the Andes range in South America and are familiar and greatly admired 
                spectacles in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Caucasus Mountains and the mountains of Scandanavia.
                Rivers of ice flow down the valleys of various Asian mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, 
                the Hindu Kush, and the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges.
                They are also a feature of the Southern Alps of New Zealand and are found in the lofty mountains 
                of New Guinea. The largest piedmont glaciers are the Malaspina and Bering glaciers, both in Alaska.
                When mice are kept at high population densities, their behaviour changes in a number of ways.
                Aggressive activity within populations of mice rises as density increases. 
                Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual activity.
                Communal nesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally.
                In one example, 58 mice one to three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest,
                most unusual communal living. None survived because most of the mothers deserted them immediately after birth.
